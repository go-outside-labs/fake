# This is 2021 and you must set your own wallet

**"Not your keys? not your bitcoins."**

## Crypto wallets for dummies
* A crypto wallet is a device (hardware (software) that stores digital assets.
* It doesnâ€™t store currency but the keys to a wallet address; private and public keys to interact on a blockchain.
* Cryptocurrencies are not stored in one location; there are just records of transactions that are stored on the blockchain.
