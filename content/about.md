## 0. basics you need to know

All right, losers, these are all the stuff you will have to learn if you desire to live in the future.

### what bitcoin is

* the first successful implementation of a distributed crypto-currency, described in part in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list.
* designed around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central authorities.
* a money-like good: portable, durable, divisible, recognizable, fungible, scarce, and difficult to counterfeit. It cannot be printed or debased, and only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist.
* open-source: nobody owns or controls it, and everyone can take part.
* the biggest revolution on money in the last thousands of year.

### dialects and concepts

* **altcoins**: is an alternative cryptocurrency to bitcoin (e.g., ethereum, Ripple's XRP (nope), and litecoin).
* **FUD**: short for "fear, uncertainty, and doubt", like FOMO and all those anxieties we all have ("take a deep breath and HODL").
* **faketoshi**: everyone claiming they are Satoshi Nakamoto.
* **get GOXED**: leave your bitcoins floating somewhere else and you might never see them again; you need your own wallet.
* **HODL**: holding the cryptocurrency rather than selling.
* **KYC coin**: "know your customer", all these platforms that ask for selfies and verification; you need to own your wallet.
* **mooning** or **"to the moon üöÄ"**: when kids get excited with crypto values rising.
* **NYKNYB**: not your keys? not your bitcoins; you need to own your wallet.
* **stacking sats**: the act of regularly accumulating bitcoin, by buying, earning, or mining.
* **sats**: short for satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin (BTC).
* **shitcoins**: an altcoin that isn't worth anything atm.
* **üíé hands**: HODL.

### how to buy coins?

* consider buying local, joining a swap group, or getting onto [BISQ](https://bisq.network/).
* if buying from big corps:
    * robinhood is a NO NO, it's a [custodial wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins#Bad_wallet_ideas) that does not allow withdrawal. Do not leave coins there.
    * coinbase gives you lower fees when paying for pro. You can then withdraw to your wallet. Still not the best option, coinbase has had a lot of problems over the years.
    * gemini and binance.us are all right in the US, kraken is all right in Europe. Withdraw to your wallet.
    * cashApp is all right in the US, and it‚Äôs a 2 step process. Step 1 is buying; step 2 is withdrawal to your wallet.
