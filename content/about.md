## 0. Basics you need to know

**‚ú® Some info that will help you navigate the years to come ‚ú®**

### What bitcoin is

* the first successful implementation of a distributed crypto-currency, described in part in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list.
* designed around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central authorities.
* a money-like good: portable, durable, divisible, recognizable, fungible, scarce, and difficult to counterfeit. It cannot be printed or debased, and only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist.
* open-source: nobody owns or controls it, and everyone can take part.
* the biggest revolution on money in the last thousands of year.

### Dialects and concepts

* **altcoins**: is an alternative cryptocurrency to bitcoin (e.g., ethereum, Ripple's XRP (nope), and litecoin).
* **FUD**: short for "fear, uncertainty, and doubt", like FOMO and all those anxieties we all have ("take a deep breath and HODL").
* **faketoshi**: everyone claiming they are Satoshi Nakamoto.
* **get GOXED**: leave your bitcoins floating somewhere else and you might never see them again; you need your own wallet.
* **HODL**: holding the cryptocurrency rather than selling.
* **KYC coin**: "know your customer", all the platforms that ask for selfies and verification for coin trading.
* **mooning** or **"to the moon üöÄ"**: when kids get excited with crypto values rising.
* **NYKNYB**: not your keys? not your bitcoins; you need to own your wallet.
* **stacking sats**: the act of regularly accumulating bitcoin, by buying, earning, or mining.
* **sats**: short for satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin (BTC).
* **shitcoins**: an altcoin that isn't worth anything atm.
* **üíé hands**: HODL.

## 10. Getting coins

### Buying
* consider buying on DEXs or getting onto [BISQ](https://bisq.network/).
    * peer-to-peer marketplaces like [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/) allow you to purchase BTC directly from a seller (be at lookout for scammers).
* if buying from online exchanges:
    * robinhood is a NO NO, it's a [custodial wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins#Bad_wallet_ideas) that does not allow withdrawal. Do not leave coins there.
    * coinbase gives you lower fees when paying for pro (btw, they are the marketmaker). You can then withdraw to your wallet.
    * gemini and binance.us are all right in the US, kraken is all right in Europe, check [this](https://cryptorationale.com/) if you are in Canada. Withdraw your sats to your wallet.
    * cashApp is all right in the US, and it‚Äôs a 2 step process. Step 1 is buying; step 2 is withdrawal to your wallet.

### Earning

* you can earn cryptocurrencies by supporting the process of verifying transactions (mining). There are lots of big players in this game now, and you will hardly make any money setting your mining box at this point (probably lose money with utility expenses).
