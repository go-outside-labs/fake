* [Stores that accept bitcoin: spendabit.co](https://spendabit.co/)
* [Crypto merchants and ATMs](https://coinmap.org/)

### Dialects and concepts

* **HODL**: holding the cryptocurrency rather than selling.
* **FUD**: short for "fear, uncertainty and doubt", like FOMO and all those anxieties we all have. The advice is *take a deep breath and HODL*.
* **Faketoshi**: everyone claiming they are Satoshi Nakamoto.
* **Mooning** or **"to the moon üöÄ"**: when kids get excited with the crypto values rising.
* **Stacking Sats**: the act of regularly accumulating bitcoin, by buying, earning, or mining.
* **Sats**: short for satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin (BTC).
* **Shitcoins**:  an altcoin that isn't worth anything atm.
* **NYKNYB**: Not your keys? Not your Bitcoins . The advice is *set your own wallet*.
