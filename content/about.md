### What bitcoin is

* the first successful implementation of a distributed crypto-currency, described in part in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list.
* designed around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central authorities.
* a money-like good: portable, durable, divisible, recognizable, fungible, scarce, and difficult to counterfeit. It cannot be printed or debased, and only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist.
* open-source: nobody owns or controls it, and everyone can take part.
* the biggest revolution on money in the last thousands of years.
* both a store of value and a payments mechanism.

### Dialects and concepts

* **altcoins**: alternative cryptocurrencies to bitcoin (e.g., ethereum, Ripple's XRP (nope), and litecoin); aims to provide price stability, ensuring a stable value over time.
* **FUD**: short for "fear, uncertainty, and doubt", like FOMO and all those anxieties we all have ("take a deep breath and HODL").
* **faketoshi**: everyone claiming they are Satoshi Nakamoto.
* **get GOXED**: leave your bitcoins floating somewhere else and you might never see them again; you need your own wallet.
* **HODL**: holding the cryptocurrency rather than selling.
* **KYC coin**: "know your customer", all the platforms that ask for selfies and verification for coin trading.
* **mooning** or **"to the moon üöÄ"**: when kids get excited with crypto values rising.
* **NYKNYB**: not your keys? not your bitcoins; you need to own your wallet.
* **stacking sats**: the act of regularly accumulating bitcoin, by buying, earning, or mining.
* **sats**: short for satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin (BTC).
* **shitcoins**: an altcoin that isn't worth anything atm.
* **üíé hands**: HODL.
